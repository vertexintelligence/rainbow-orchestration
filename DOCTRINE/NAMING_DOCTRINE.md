# MASTER NAMING DOCTRINE v1.0 (LOCKED)

## RAINBOW — Local Sovereign Layer
Anything running on local hardware (WSL/Docker/LAN). Private-by-default.
RAINBOW = execution, security, memory, incident replay, performance tuning.

## GENX — Public Intelligence Layer
Anything shared publicly (repo/docs/API surface/dashboard branding).
GENX = interface, documentation, client-facing surfaces, public integrations.

## Non-Negotiable Separation
1) No secrets in GENX (ever).
2) GENX can fail gracefully; RAINBOW must remain sovereign.
3) All upgrades prove in RAINBOW before release into GENX.
4) Naming prefixes must not mix across layers.

## Reserved Expansion Names
RAINBOW_OS, RAINBOW_KERNEL, RAINBOW_MEMORY, RAINBOW_SENTINEL, RAINBOW_DOCTOR
GENX_API, GENX_DASHBOARD, GENX_CLIENT_PORTAL, GENX_CLOUD
